Are you still looking for a simple and convenient Minecraft Server Manager? PHPMC 7 may be your best choice!

> PHPMC 7 is a Powerful Minecraft Server Manager, Developed by Akkariin

### Introduction
Hello, I am Akkariin, this is my first Minecraft server manager project.

I wanted to develop a Minecraft server manager long ago, so I recently spent some time developing the PHPMC 7 project.

Sorry for my poor English, I used Google Translate to write this ReadMe, so there may be some grammatical mistakes.

### The main function
> 1. Complete Minecraft server management capabilities
> 2. Support cross-platform, it can run on Windows and Linux, even Android phones
> 3. Support for multiple nodes and distributed
> 4. Has FTP file transfer function
> 5. Support for Docker containers (starting containers by command invocation)
> 6. Can run game servers other than Minecraft

### Security
PHPMC 7 does not use MD5, we use secure hashes like BCrypt

We use the Java Daemon to read output through the IO stream, which is more efficient.

Because any command can be executed through the panel, it is recommended that you do not use it for commercial rental, otherwise there may be a security risk.

PHPMC 7 supports permission subdivision, and permissions can be set for each operation.
