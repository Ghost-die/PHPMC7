> PHPMC 7 is a Powerful Minecraft Server Manager, Developed by Akkariin

### Introduction
Hello, I am Akkariin, this is my first Minecraft server manager project.

I always wanted to build a Minecraft server manager a long ago, so I recently spent some time to develop the fascinating PHPMC 7 Minecraft server management panel.

### Features
> 1. Complete Minecraft server management capabilities
> 2. Runs on multiple platforms, it runs on Windows and Linux, even Android phones
> 3. Supports multiple nodes and distributed daemons on different servers
> 4. Supports FTP file transfer system
> 5. Supports Doker Containers(With some modifications on server starting command)
> 6. Supports any game that allows you to run your own server.

### Security & Performance
We do not use MD5 hashes because nowadays its possible to be reverse decrypted. We uses irreversible hashes like BCrypt.

We uses JAVA I/O Stream to send commands and read & write logs, it makes the stream process more stable with higher efficiency.

PHPMC supports Docker to run servers, but it is not recommanded to use PHPMC 7 as commercial purposes.

PHPMC supports privilege subdivision and almost every single operation can be controlled by privilege subdivision system.
